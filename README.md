# STEMFIE-file-repository
The official file repository of the STEMFIE construction-set toy

STEMFIE is an open-sourced educational construction-set toy you can download and make using a 3D printer at home. Inspired by the vintage build set Meccano, each component is a part of a mechanical ecosystem of compatible shapes designed to interlock through various connections and fasteners.

The shape and orientation of every STEMFIE file are optimized for 3D printing on a filament-based 3D printer. 

All 3D files and graphics are made in FreeCAD, Blender, Inkscape and Krita.
