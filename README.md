### The official file repository of the STEMFIE construction-set toy

**STEMFIE** is an open-sourced educational construction-set toy you can download and make using an affordable off-the-shelf 3D printer. 

Inspired by the vintage toy [Meccano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meccano), I designed each component as a part of a mechanical ecosystem of compatible shapes defined to interlock through various connections and fasteners.

This file repository contains mainly the three following file types.

* **.STL** - Commonly used for single parts, you can import them into your 3D printer's slicing software or your 3D modeling/CAD software.
* **.3mf** - Commonly used for single parts and ready-to-print nested build plates.
* **.stpZ** - Used for single parts describing the non-destructive shape and form of the part's design. Use this file to import it into your CAD software. If it can't open .stpZ, please download [FreeCAD](https://freecad.org) to open the files.
* **.FCStd** - The original project file of parts and assemblies containing the parametric data for generating the part's shape. FCStd is FreeCAD's native file format.

The shape and orientation of every STEMFIE file are optimized for 3D printing without the need for support structures on a filament-based 3D printer.

All 3D files and graphics are made in [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD), [Blender](https://github.com/blender/blender), [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), and [Krita](https://
