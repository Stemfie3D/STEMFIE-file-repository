# STEMFIE-file-repository
### The official file repository of the STEMFIE construction-set toy

STEMFIE is an open-sourced educational construction-set toy you can download and make using a 3D printer at home. Inspired by the vintage toy Meccano, each component is a part of a mechanical ecosystem of compatible shapes designed to interlock through various connections and fasteners.

The shape and orientation of every STEMFIE file are optimized for 3D printing without the need for support structures on a filament-based 3D printer.  

All 3D files and graphics are made in FreeCAD, Blender, Inkscape, and Krita.
