Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
"STEM" redirects here. For other uses, see STEM (disambiguation) and Stem (disambiguation).
Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a broad term used to group together these academic disciplines.[1] This term is typically used to address an education policy or curriculum choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy.  The science in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major branches of science: natural sciences, including biology, physics, and chemistry; and formal sciences, of which mathematics is an example, along with logic and statistics. The third major branch of science, social science such as: psychology, sociology, and political science, are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS (Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences), rebranded in the UK in 2020 as SHAPE. 

FAQ - STEMFIE.org https://stemfie.org
Q: What are the recommended print settings for STEMFIE?
A: I designed @Stemfie3D to 3D-print optimally, using standard print settings on filament-based 3D-printers, such as the following:
Material: PLA filament
Layer height: 0.2 mm
Perimeters (shells): 2
Top solid layer count: 4
Bottom solid layer count: 3
Infill: 15%
Generic print speed: 50 mm/s
Q: Do I need to use support structures in my printer's slicing software?
A: No. Every STEMFIE STL file is designed to print without support structures. 
Q: How many files, what types of part will be published, and when?
A: The STEMFIE project contains many parts which are currently 3D-modelled and soon will be ready for publishing. The construction kit has a vast ecosystem of components similar to traditional mechanical playsets. All parts will be gradually published here on STEMFIE.org, having the central file repository via get.stemfie.org â€“ where users can browse all part and download them. 
Q: What are the license terms of the STEMFIE project?
A: Read about the license.

Downloading and sharing - All STEMFIE files are available free of charge for anyone to download https://stemfie.org/downloads.html , store, share and print.

Modification - Everyone can remix, adapt, or build upon the files and the STEMFIE standard. If you re-share your files and STEMFIE projects, please give them a short attribution in your own words by writing about the source: STEMFIE.org https://stemfie.org/STEMFIE.org , and on social media, please consider using the hashtag #Stemfie3D. I appreciate contributions to the STEMFIE construction set; please submit your files and improvement suggestions operations@stemfie.org . 

Saving costs - If you are a school or similar institution looking for providing a new educational construction set toy, feel free to download https://stemfie.org/donation and 3D-print STEMFIE parts and projects. You can produce as many as you want, at will, in your location. 

Commercial use (individuals, schools, organisations, etc.) - If you are an individual acting in your hobby interest or are a part of an organisation (schools, libraries, retirement homes, FabLabs, maker spaces, etc.), I highly encourage and support the commercial use of the STEMFIE project. Feel free to print and sell any STEMFIE parts and projects, as well as your creations; after all, you are the one feeding and taking care of your 3D printer! ;-) If you would like to help to improve and expand the STEMFIE project, please consider a contribution.

Commercial use (manufacturers) - If you are a manufacturer of products and are interested in the STEMFIE construction set toy, please send https://stemfie.org/license.html an enquiry.
